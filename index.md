#### PDEOpNet is a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) trained to solve key families of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) including the heat equation, Navier-Stokes and TODO 

Systems defined by PDEs can be seen all around us. Whether in the diffusion of heat or quantum mechanics, physicists, engineergs, mathematicians and more rely on PDEs to model and understand the world.
