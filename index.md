#### PDEOpNet is a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) trained to solve key families of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) including the heat equation, Navier-Stokes and TODO 

Systems defined by PDEs can be seen all around us. Whether in the diffusion of heat or quantum mechanics, physicists, engineers, mathematicians, and more rely on PDEs to model and understand the world.

PINNs are a cutting-edge class of models that unite the data-driven approach to modeling that is central to machine learning with the differential equations that are key in many scientific disciplines. Rather than learning from mass amounts of data alone, PINNs supplement this data and guide the learning process by enforcing a differential loss on the model. This means that, in addition to learning features from the data, the model will also adhere to the functional relationship defined by differential equations.
