## Project Progress Report (17 November 2023)

This page is the Project Progress Report for 17 November 2023. This page will discuss the state of the project as of that date. We will begin by describing the data used for our project and how it was attained. We will then present three plots of our data to help visualize key aspects of our progress. We will describe more generally what work we have done so far, and create a plan for the next weeks until the project due date. Finally, we will provide a brief reflection on what we have learned so far.
